3. Run on Replit.com

4. In Replit.com, add a new secret named DATABASE_URL and make the value your Realtime Database' Hosted URL, where your database is present.

5. Run and test the app in Replit

6. Once the Apollo Server is seen live on your repl, click on the "QUERY YOUR SERVER" button and start querying your Database with parameters like: fullName, age, location etc.
